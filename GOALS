The need for an R to Clojure conversion pipeline

R is the dominant open-source language and software environment for
statistical computing and graphics. The R community is very large and
active. A few thousand open-source packages are available. An impressive
example is the "caret" package for classification and regression training
which offers a unified interface to more than a hundred different predictive
modelling schemes. Moreover, the community is still growing and rapidly
producing new software.

Therefore it would be to a great advantage of the Clojure and Incanter
community to have a working conversion pipeline capable of leveraging the
scale and the growth rate of the R community.

The R community would also benefit from the existence of a conversion
pipeline to Clojure. Currently it is difficult to handle very large data in
R, and its capabilities to take advantage of multiple cores and computer
clusters are limited and cover only a small fraction of R functionality. A
conversion pipeline to Clojure would offer a path towards wider
parallelization of R software.

The R is also known as a rather quircky language, and many organizations
don't trust its runtime enough to put it onto real-time production servers
where 100% uptime is expected. So the models trained in R are often
re-written in a more robust industrial language such as, for example, Java,
before being placed on a production server. A conversion pipeline to Clojure
would make it possible to run R-trained models inside JVM and would
eliminate many of those re-writes.
